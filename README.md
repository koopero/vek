`vek` is an incomplete, quirky little geometry library. It exists to generate
some shapes and patterns for another project.

Some interesting properties of `vek`:
- All vectors have an arbitrary number of axes.
- It's *not* fast, nor is it intended to be.
- Most functions take an arbitrary number of arguments.
